<h1>About This Project</h1>
<br>
<p>
  This project is a Comic Collection app where users can browse, search, and add reviews for their favorite comics. 
  The system allows users to create new comics, associate them with a publisher and series, and leave ratings and reviews.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  The Comic Collection app was built using Ruby on Rails with a relational database that includes entities such as:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Users</strong>: Can add comics, write reviews, and search for comics.</li>
    <li><strong>Comics</strong>: Contains title, description, publisher, and series. Users can add new comics and write reviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Publishers</strong>: Comics are associated with publishers.</li>
    <li><strong>Series</strong>: Comics are grouped by series.</li>
    <li><strong>Reviews</strong>: Users can leave reviews for comics.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h5>Datasets</h5>
<p>Data Types:<br>
Datasets can include various types of data:<br>
Numerical Data: Data that consists of numbers (e.g., age, salary, temperature).<br>
Categorical Data: Data that can be divided into categories (e.g., gender, country, product type).<br>
Text Data: Data represented in text (e.g., reviews, articles, names).<br>
Time-Series Data: Data points indexed by time (e.g., stock prices, weather data).<br>
Images/Videos: Data in visual format (e.g., photos, scans, videos).<br>
Geospatial Data: Data that includes geographic locations (e.g., GPS coordinates, maps).<br>
<br>
Structure of a Dataset:<br>
Rows (Records/Entries): Each row typically represents a single data point or record. For example, in a dataset of people, each row might represent an individual person.<br>
Columns (Attributes/Features): Each column represents a specific characteristic or feature of the data. For instance, in a dataset of books, columns might include title, author, and publication year.<br>
<br>
Types of Datasets:<br>
Structured Datasets: Data is organized in rows and columns, often found in relational databases or spreadsheets (e.g., CSV, Excel files).<br>
Unstructured Datasets: Data is not organized in a predefined manner and may require preprocessing before it can be analyzed (e.g., images, audio files).<br>
Semi-Structured Datasets: Data that does not conform strictly to a table but still has some organizational structure (e.g., JSON, XML).<br>
<br>
<h2>Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)</h2>
<p>
  Below is the ERD that shows how all the entities in the database are related:
